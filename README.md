# Katas

In programming we use Katas to practice different programming patterns in the same way that martial artists do, through constant repetition and practice. We want to make most of these patterns almost second nature so we can think about the larger problem instead of trying to get the code to do what we want.

In this section, we will be completing a series of exercises that will allow us to practice everything we've learned so far. Create a new file for each kata, and remember to practice using EDD to solve each problem.
